/** The `job` stanza is the top-most configuration option in the job specification.
  * A job is a declarative specification of tasks that Nomad should run. Jobs have a
  * globally unique name, one or many task groups, which are themselves collections
  * of one or many tasks.
  *
  * @param datacenters A list of datacenters in the region which are eligible for task placement. This must be provided, and does not have a default.
  * @param groups Specifies the start of a group of tasks. This can be provided multiple times to define additional groups. Group names must be unique within the job file.
  * @param all_at_once Controls if the entire set of tasks in the job must be placed atomically or if they can be scheduled incrementally. This should only be used for special circumstances.
  * @param constraints This can be provided multiple times to define additional constraints. See the [Nomad constraint reference](/docs/job-specification/constraint.html) for more details.
  * @param meta Specifies a key-value map that annotates with user-defined metadata
  * @param parameterized Specifies the job as a parameterized job such that it can be dispatched against.
  * @param periodic Allows the job to be scheduled at fixed times, dates or intervals.
  * @param priority Specifies the job priority which is used to prioritize scheduling and access to resources. Must be between 1 and 100 inclusively, with a larger value corresponding to a higher priority.
  * @param region The region in which to execute the job.
  * @param jobType Specifies the [Nomad scheduler][scheduler] to use. Nomad provides the `service`, `system: and `batch: schedulers.
  * @param update Specifies the task's update strategy. When omitted, rolling updates are disabled.
  * @param vault Specifies the set of Vault policies required by all tasks in this job.
  * @param vault_token Specifies the Vault token that proves the submitter of the job has access to the specified policies in the [`vault`][vault] stanza. This field is only used to transfer the token and is not stored after job submission.
  *   It is **strongly discouraged** to place the token as a configuration parameter like this, since the token could be checked into source control accidentally. Users should set the `VAULT_TOKEN: environment variable when running the job instead.
